# WhiteBox - Services and Data Access

## Data strategy

WhiteBox now uses PostgreSQL-backed read models for the TWA. Mock data is legacy/static fallback only.

Important principles:

- Marketplace, partners, wallet, map, history, profile, onboarding, promo codes and referral flows are API-driven.
- Points are company-scoped and stored in `UserCompany` + `LoyaltyTransaction`.
- Company branches are stored in `CompanyLocation` with geocoded coordinates and working hours.
- Subscription payment providers are stubbed for now; activation is a non-payment flow.
- Production migrations are applied by GitHub Actions after `main` verification succeeds.

## Frontend API clients

- `src/lib/api/auth-client.ts` - login/register/session/account actions.
- `src/lib/api/categories-client.ts` - categories and favorite categories.
- `src/lib/api/admin-client.ts` - admin users, companies, categories, subscriptions, growth, audit and backups.
- `src/lib/api/twa-client.ts` - TWA profile, dashboard, marketplace, companies, wallet, map/history/subscriptions, QR, promo/referral.
- `src/lib/i18n/*` - locale detection, persistence and portable dictionaries.
- `src/lib/telegram/*` - Telegram Bot API delivery, proxy support, webhook parsing and admin account linking.

## Backend responsibilities

- `AuthService`: registration, login, refresh, password change, freeze/reactivate, login events and email confirmation.
- `AdminService`: users, companies, categories, locations, subscriptions, growth, audit, backups and analytics.
- `RegisteredService`: DB-backed TWA read models, profile preferences, favorites, promo/referral redemption, QR and subscription activation.
- `MaintenanceStateService`: restore progress state machine.
- `MaintenanceGuard`: API lock during restore.
- Landing lead services: contact intake, duplicate/spam checks, Telegram delivery history and retries.
- Company onboarding services: user-first company registration, identity verification modes, encrypted passport file lifecycle and admin review.
- Telegram services: Bot API proxy support, direct-message admin linking and webhook command handling.
- i18n services: locale cookie, user preference persistence and structured translation dictionaries.

## Security and privacy responsibilities

- Passwords remain write-only and are never exposed through admin UI.
- Email changes use secure request links rather than direct admin edits.
- Passport photos are stored encrypted in private local storage, then removed after approve/reject cleanup.
- Support users are restricted away from finance, passport review and privileged verification actions.
- Critical admin actions write audit records where applicable.

## Map/geocoder responsibilities

- Admin calls location endpoints with human-readable address.
- API resolves address through Yandex Geocoder and stores coordinates/precision metadata.
- API rejects duplicate addresses for the same company.
- TWA `/map` renders active locations with custom category markers and zoom-aware clustering.
- Route links are generated client-side for Yandex Maps; geolocation is included when user allowed it.

## CI/CD responsibilities

- PRs run full verification against temporary PostgreSQL.
- Merge to `main` runs the same verification and production `prisma migrate deploy` using GitHub Secrets.
- Railway deploys web/API from `main` using service-aware root scripts.
