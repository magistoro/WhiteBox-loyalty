## Company-specific points

Points are not universal. They belong to a company:

- `UserCompany.balance` is the current company balance.
- `LoyaltyTransaction.companyId` records the company for every earn/spend event.
- Promo/referral point rewards must resolve to a company and then update the same ledger/balance system.

## Telegram admin notifications

Telegram delivery is routed through database users:

- `User.telegramId` stores the linked private Telegram chat id.
- Active `ADMIN`, `SUPER_ADMIN` and `MANAGER` users receive landing lead and company verification notifications.
- Environment variables configure the bot and webhooks only; they do not define human notification recipients.

## Location model

`CompanyLocation` stores real branches:

- `address`, `city`, coordinates and geocoder precision/metadata.
- `openTime`, `closeTime`, `workingDays` for open-now filtering.
- `isMain` for primary branch display.
- `isActive` for hiding branches from the TWA map and partner cards.

Duplicate addresses are rejected server-side per company after normalization/geocoder resolution.

## Backup payload

DB backup schema version `2` serializes operational tables including company memberships, purchases, subscription entitlements, redemptions, finance operations and admin tasks. Restore is destructive and protected by maintenance mode.

## Admin work queue

`AdminTask` is a deduplicated operational work item, not one copy per administrator:

- `sourceKey` uniquely connects a task to its origin, for example `audit:<id>` or `verification:<uuid>`.
- Open company verifications and pending finance operations synchronize into tasks and close when the linked workflow is completed.
- Critical audit signals, including Telegram delivery fire alerts, create an actionable task leading to the source context.
- Task visibility is filtered by the administrator's matching permission scope: audit, company verification or finance.
