# WhiteBox - Project Map

## Current product shape

WhiteBox is a loyalty marketplace with four active surfaces:

- TWA/mobile client app for end users.
- Public landing and verified company intake.
- Admin portal for operations, analytics, growth, database map, backups, audit, support and verification.
- Company portal placeholder for partner-facing finance/compliance flows.

The runtime is a monorepo:

## Local and production environments

- Local development should use Docker PostgreSQL from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Production DB credentials live in Railway variables and GitHub Secrets, not in committed files.
- PRs run full checks against a temporary GitHub Actions PostgreSQL service.
- Pushes to `main` run the same checks and then apply production Prisma migrations.
- Railway deploys `whitebox-api` and `whitebox-web` from `main`.

## Notes

- User-facing TWA surfaces are DB-backed through `/api/registered/*`; `mockData` is legacy/static fallback only.
- Points are company-scoped. Promo/referral point rewards require a company context and write normal loyalty ledger rows.
- Company addresses are stored as `CompanyLocation` with coordinates, hours and active/main flags.
- Company verification creates a user first and then links/activates company access after admin approval.
- Passport photos are encrypted in local private storage and removed after approve/reject cleanup.
- Admin UI uses one global language switcher in the navigation shell; page strings are moving into structured dictionaries.
- Payment providers are intentionally stubbed; subscription activation is currently a non-payment flow.
